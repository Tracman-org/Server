		<p>Feel free to use this link to create an account.&ensp;Note that you will need a google account to continue.&ensp;You will also need an android phone to update your location.&ensp;</p>
		<p class='invite'><a href="https://tracman.org/invited/{{id}}">http://tracman.org/invited/{{id}}</a></p>
		<p>You will be asked to sign into google and authorize the Tracman app.&ensp;</p>
		<p>Please keep in mind that this is experimental software, and I am not responsible for it actually working properly, or anything else for that matter.&ensp;You have read the <a href="https://tracman.org/#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>, haven't you?&ensp;</p>
		<p>Regards,
