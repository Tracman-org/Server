			<h3>A word from the developer</h3>

			<p>Hi Folks, </p>

			<p>Glad you're enjoying my website and app.  I made the whole thing, from front to backend,
			and I'm really proud of it!  However, I'm a long-haul trucker by day and coding is just a hobby.
			I don't make any money off this website, and I pay the server fees out of my own pocket.  Do you
			pity me enough to donate some money by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=56toCNZRvXj-_J6kC_5D258zMwjyU7hLvxKFQXsIG5_nzVlAhEw2VLFf7K0&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8defcd6970d4fd9d661117ac2649af92bb">paypal</a>
			 or <a href="bitcoin:1GXbuM398Y2tYwSaQhNQHXWF1AN6GeRgQh?label=tracman">bitcoin</a>?  </p>

			<p>To make a little money off this service, I'm going to be offering a pro version with more
			features.  It'll be cheap, probably $1 or $2 per month.  However, while Tracman is in beta,
			you can beta test the pro version too.  Be sure to inform me about any <a href="/bug">bugs</a>
			you encounter or <a href="/suggestion">suggestions</a> you have.  And keep in mind that at some
			point, when we launch out of beta, Tracman Pro will <em>not</em> be free and <strong>you will
			lose your pro membership</strong> unless start paying for it.

			<p>That said, just click the button below to test out the pro features.  Keep in mind, they are
			as <a href="/#disclaimer">unstable</a> as the rest of this product.

			<p>Cheers, <br>
