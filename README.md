###### v 0.7.5

node.js application to display a sharable map with user's location.


## Installation

On unix-based systems:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tracman-org/Server.git &&\
mv Server tracman-server && cd tracman-server &&\
exec npm install
```

You will need to set up a configuration file at `config/env/env.js`.  Use `config/env/sample.js` for an example.  You can get API keys at the [google developer's console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).  You will need to set up approved hosts and auth callbacks.  There is more information in [their documentation](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158857?hl=en).  

A good method is to simply copy the sample configuration and point `config/env/env.js` to the new version: 

```sh
cp config/env/sample.js config/env/local-config.js
echo "module.exports = require('./local-config.js');" > config/env/env.js
```

Then edit `config/env/local-config.js` to match your local environment.  


## Usage

Run Tracman with npm: 

```sh
npm run minify && npm start
```

...or with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/):

```sh
npm run nodemon
```

Nodemon will automatically minify files and restart the app when you make changes.  Check out the `nodemon.json` configuration.  


## Contributing

Tracman will be updated according to [this branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)... more or less.  If you know anything about programming Android, [the Tracman android app](https://github.com/Tracman-org/Android) is more desperate for help.
