# Tracman
###### v 0.5.1

node.js application to display a map with user's location.  

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Tracman-org/Server.git && (cd Server && exec npm install)
```

You will need to set up a configuration file at `config/env.js`.  It should contain the following information: 

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = {

	mode: 'development', // or 'production'
	
	// Random strings to prevent hijacking
	session: 'this is a secret',
	cookie: 'shhhhh',
	
	// Client IDs for authentication
	googleClientId: '############-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com',
	googleClientSecret: 'XXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	facebookAppId: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	facebookAppSecret: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	twitterConsumerKey: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	twitterConsumerSecret: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	
	// A google maps API key
	googleMapsAPI: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	
	// Location of your mongoDB
	mongoSetup: 'mongodb://localhost/tracman',
	
	// URL and port where Tracman will be run. 
	url: 'http://localhost:8080',
	port: 8080
	
};
```

Use `config/env-sample.js` for help.  

You can get API keys at the [google developer's console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).  You will need to set up approved hosts and auth callbacks.  There is more information in [their documentation](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158857?hl=en).
